/* Create a file aclled OddStack.Java. in it create a class OddStack.
 * 
 *   OddStack must have 3 methods:
 *    public void push(int e)
 *    public int pop()
 *    @Override  (not req'd but helps prevent errors)
 *    public String toString()
 *
 * OddStack is like most stacks. It takes in integers. The first integer
 *  pushed in is the last one popped out, but OddStack has one odd feature:
 *  all the odd integers that are pushed (like 5, 37 or 1) get popped before
 *  any even integer get popped even if an even integer is pushed after the
 *  odd ones. Other than that it maintains the order. 
 * The toString method prints out the elements in the form
 *  [e1, e2, ... en], but it prints them in the order they would be popped
 *  (not the order that they were pushed).
 * You are free to implement your OddStack any way you want, as long as
 *  you do not use a Stack library from Java.
 * The stack itself holds 10 elements. If you try to push to a full stack
 *  it must give the error:
 *   Error: OddStack is full
 * If you try to pop form a stack that is empty it must give the error:
 *   Error: OddStack is empty
 * Beyond that they only other thing that it should print is a confirmation
 *  when you push an element. 
 *  For example push(35) should report:
 *   Pushing: 35
 * Remember, you have limited space for compiling and running your program,
 *  so do not make your class too complex.
 *
 *  Compile: javac -J-Xmx10m -J-Xms5m OddStack.java
 *  Run: java -Xmx10m -Xms5m W11Main
 *
 *
 * Running with "Driver" in place of "W11Main" automatically calls main
 *  found in ur class
